[#01-prerequisites]
== Prerequisites

During this tutorial, it will be required to work with different tools for running the exercises included. Please install the following software:

include::partial$requirements.adoc[]

NOTE: Please review the official documentation to install the latest versions of these tools on your laptop following the optimum procedure 

It is also required to have a https://github.com[GitHub] account in order to create some repositories during this tutorial.

[#01-laboratory]
== Laboratory

The technical exercises included in this tutorial are based on cloud native solutions which are extensively used in the IT market. Please review the following list which includes the basics around these cloud native solutions:

- https://github.com/[GitHub] is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.
- https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/[Red Hat Openshift Container Platform Cluster] is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform with full-stack automated operations to manage hybrid cloud, multicloud, and edge deployments. Red Hat OpenShift is optimized to improve developer productivity and promote innovation.
- https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/[ArgoCD] is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes following the GitOps pattern of using Git repositories as the source of truth for defining the desired application state. Argo CD automates the deployment of the desired application states in the specified target environments. Application deployments can track updates to branches, tags, or pinned to a specific version of manifests at a Git commit.
- https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/[Argo Rollouts] provides advanced deployment capabilities such as blue-green, canary, canary analysis, experimentation, and progressive delivery features to Kubernetes.
- https://helm.sh/[Helm] is a tool to find, share, and use software built for Kubernetes. Helm helps users manage Kubernetes applications in terms of definition, installing, and upgrading even the most complex Kubernetes applications.


During this tutorial, a set of resources are provided by the instructor in order to be able to complete the exercises described in the following sections. The main objective of these resources is to provide a platform, multiple templates and other resources which are required to create different objects in Openshift.

Please review the following list to have an overall understanding of the resources provided for completing this tutorial:

- An Openshift cluster that will host and make available a set of applications deployed
- An ArgoCD installation that allows attendees to deploy applications in a GitOps fashion
- An Argo Rollouts installation that allows attendees to deploy applications using deployment strategies such as Blue/Green and Canary 
- A set of GitHub repositories that include the templates and automatisms required to deploy a group of applications
- https://github.com/davidseve/cloud-native-deployment-strategies[GitHub - Cloud Native Deployment Strategies Repository] 


[#01-parameters]
=== Parameters

The instructor provides the users with the necessary Openshift credentials and other important parameters at the beginning of this tutorial to access and complete the laboratory. 

The following table includes the parameters that the instructor should provide you at the beginning of the laboratory:

[cols="2*^,2*.",options="header,+attributes"]
|===
|**Name**|**Value**
| Openshift Cluster API (Access CLI)
| _https://api.%CLUSTER%:6443_
| Openshift Cluster Console
| _https://console-openshift-console.apps.%CLUSTER%_
| Openshift Domain
| _%CLUSTER%_
| Openshift Apps Domain
| _apps.%CLUSTER%_
| Username
| {user}
| Password
| {user}
| App Namespace GitOps
| {user}-gitops-argocd
| App Namespace for Blue-Green deployment
| {user}-blue-green
| App Namespace for Canary deployment
| {user}-canary
| App Namespace for Canary deployment with Service Mesh
| {user}-canary-service-mesh
| ArgoCD console
| _https://argocd-server-user01-gitops-argocd.apps.%CLUSTER%/_
|===

[#01-accessconsole]
=== Access - OCP Console

In addition, access Openshift Console using your credentials via browser to check connectivity and accessibility to the console:

- _https://console-openshift-console.apps.%CLUSTER%_

[#01-accesscli]
=== Access - OC Client

The OpenShift Container Platform CLI (which needs to be installed first) exposes the commands for managing your applications as well as the lower-level tools to interact with each component of your system. With the `oc` command, you can create applications and manage OpenShift Container Platform projects from a terminal.

Please check that you have followed the pre-requisites with your instructor and connect to the cluster executing the next command from your terminal:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc login -u {user} -p {user} {cluster_api}
----

If the login is successful, it should show an output similar to the following screenshot:

.OC CLI Login Output 
image::oc_login_output.png["OC CLI Login Output"]

TIP: Please pay special attention to _oc CLI_  because you will need to use this tool several times during this tutorial.

As shown in the output, the user will have access to the following namespaces:

* *{user}-gitops-argocd*: It contains Argo CD installation and all the GitOps objects.
* *{user}-blue-green*: It will contain the application using Blue/Green deployment.
* *{user}-canary*: It will contain the application using Canary deployment.
* *{user}-canary-service-mesh*: It will contain the application using Canary deployment with Service Mesh.

Each user will have its own four namespaces.

[#01-accessArgoCD]
=== Access - ArgoCD dashboard
 
The ArgoCD web console will give you access to control how the git repo is synced with Openshift, as well as check the real status of the synchronization. In order to log in to the web console, access to _https://argocd-server-{user}-gitops-argocd.apps.%CLUSTER%/_

Argo CD upon installation generates an initial admin password which is stored in a Kubernetes secret. In order to retrieve this password, run the following command to decrypt the admin password:
 
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc extract secret/argocd-cluster -n {user}-gitops-argocd --to=-
----
 
Log into Argo CD with `admin` username and the password retrieved from the previous step.

.ArgoCD login screen
image::argocd_login.png["ArgoCD login screen"]

If the login is successful, you will see the home screen where your applications will be created.

.ArgoCD applications

[#01-cloneGit]
=== Clone the GitOps repository

Following the GitOps practices, all the deployment configuration is stored in the git repo. We have created an initial repository that you will change to configure your deployment. As part of the demo, you will have to do some changes and commits. Fork the repository and clone it in your local machine, as you don't have write permissions on the initial git repo.

Access the https://github.com/rhte2023-argo-rollouts/dstrategies-app-deployment[DStrategy App Deployment] repository and fork it on your GitHub account. If prompted, choose to fork the `main` branch.

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git clone https://github.com/chamge_me/dstrategies-app-deployment
cd dstrategies-app-deployment
----

[#01-clusterSetup]
== Cluster Setup

Please visit https://github.com/rhte2023-argo-rollouts/ocp-cluster-setup.git[Openshift Cluster Setup] for more information about setting up an Openshift cluster in order to run this workshop.
