# Blue/Green deployment strategy
include::_attributes.adoc[]


*Blue-green deployment* is a strategy for updating running computer systems with *minimal downtime*. The operator maintains two environments, dubbed blue and green. One serves production traffic (the version all users use), while the other is updated.

For instance, the old version is the blue environment, while the new version is the green environment. Once all the *production traffic is fully transferred from blue to green*, blue can be kept as-is for a possible rollback or be updated to become the template upon which the next update is made.

* Advantages:
** Minimize downtime.
** A quick way to roll back.
** Smoke testing.
* Disadvantages:
** Doubling of total resources.
** Backward compatibility.

### How-to Blue/Green

In this example, we have two versions up and running in production: online and offline. We also have routers and services for offline and online pointing to the corresponding microservice. As explained above, we can deploy a new version of the microservice in the green service ("offline") and perform *smoke tests* against it to ensure that the new version will perform correctly when real traffic begins to arrive to Green.

When a new version is ready for real users, we only have to modify the k8s service to point to the new deployment (Green) as in the following image. There is minimal downtime and we can do a rapid rollback just by undoing the changes in the service.

As with great power comes great responsibility, you have to take the following into account:

* We need to *double the total resources used*: CPU, RAM, Persistent Storage, etc. We will see how to minimize this effect.
* We have to be *ready for a rapid rollback*. In case of seeing any issue in the monitorization, we should be able to modify the service to point back to the first deployment.
* We need to keep *backward compatibility*. If not, we would not be able to perform rollbacks.



## Deploy Dstrategies Application

We are going to create the application `dstrategies`, that we will use to test Blue/Green deployment. Because we will make changes in the application's GitHub repository, we have to use the repository that you have just forked. Please edit the following yaml and set your own GitHub repository in the `reportURL`. Create a file called `application-dstrategies-blue-green.yaml`

Looking at the Argo CD dashboard, you would notice that we have a new `dstrategies` application.

## Application architecture

We have a very simple application that has two services. One frontal React app call `dstrategies-front` and one backend Quarkus app call `dstrategies-back`. We will use the front app to call several times the back app and see how the back version change during the deployment.

To achieve Blue/Green deployment with `Cloud Native` applications using **Argo Rollouts**, we have designed this architecture.

This is our current status:

image::rollout-blue-green-step-0.png["Dstrategies initial status"]

OpenShift Components - Online

- Routes and Services declared with the suffix -online
- Routes mapped only to the online services
- Services mapped to the rollout.
 
OpenShift Components - Offline

- Routes and Services declared with the suffix -offline
- Routes mapped only to the offline services
- Services mapped to the rollout

We have defined an active or online service 'dstrategies-back-online' and a preview or offline service 'dstrategies-back-offline'. Final user will always use 'dstrategies-back-online'. 

We have created an AnalysisTemplate 'dstrategies-back-analysis-template' that just validates the health of the application, for production environments a better analysis should be done. **Argo Rollouts** use this AnalysisTemplate to validate a new version and set whether it is ready to be promoted or not. To learn more, please read https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/features/bluegreen/[this].

## Test Dstrategies application
 
We have deployed the `dstrategies` with ArgoCD. We can test that it is up and running.

TODO change to front
 
We have to get the Online route
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl "$(oc get routes dstrategies-back-online -n {user}-blue-green --template='https://{{.spec.host}}')/dstrategies-back"

And the Offline route
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl "$(oc get routes dstrategies-back-offline -n {user}-blue-green --template='https://{{.spec.host}}')/dstrategies-back"
----
Notice that in each microservice response we have added metadata information to see better the `version` of each application. This will help us to see the changes while we do the Blue/Green deployment.
Because right now we have both routers against the same rollout revision we will have the same response with version `V1.0.0`:




We can also see the rollout`s status.

## Dstrategies-back Blue/Green deployment
We have split a `Cloud Native` Blue/Green deployment into two steps:

1. Deploy a new version.
2. Promote a new version
 
To test Blue/Green deployment we are going to do changes in the backend application dstrategies-back.
 
We have already deployed the dstrategies-back version V1.0.0, and we are ready to use a new dstrategies-back version V2.0.0 that has a new `description` attribute.

### Step 1 - Deploy a new version
 
We will deploy a new version `V2.0.0`. To do it, we have to edit the file `helm/helm-umbrella-dstrategies/chart/values/blue-green/values-image-tag.yaml` under `dstrategies-back` set `tag` value to `V2.0.0`

[.console-input]
[source,input,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
dstrategies-back:
   image:
     tag: V2.0.0
----

And push the changes
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Change dstrategies-back version to V2.0.0"
git push
----

ArgoCD will refresh the status after some minutes. If you don't want to wait you can refresh it manually from ArgoCD UI.

image::argocd-Dstrategies-blue-green-Refresh.png["Refresh Dstrategies"]
 
**Argo Rollouts** will automatically deploy the new dstrategies-back version and execute the `prePromotionAnalysis`.

If the `prePromotionAnalysis` goes well, we can see that offline applications have version V2.0.0 and the new attribute description, but the online version has not changed.

This is our current status:

image::rollout-blue-green-step-1.png["Dstrategies Step 1]

 TODO add fornt image


Functional testing users can execute `Smoke tests` to validate this new V2.0.0 version.

We have to be careful with those tests in a production environment because the product microservice will call the online dependencies.
If this dependency is for example a production DB we will create the things that our `Smoke tests` do.
 
### Step 2 - Promote a new version
 
We are going to open the new version to final users.

Execute this command to promote dstrategies-back:
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl argo rollouts promote dstrategies-back -n {user}-blue-green
----

First **Argo Rollouts** will just change the service to use the new release (ReplicaSet). We `minimize downtime` because it just changes the service label.

And after `scaleDownDelaySeconds` **Argo Rollouts** will scale down the first replicaSet (V1.0.0).

This is our final status:

TODO add front image

**We have in the online environment the new version V2.0.0!!!**


### Rollback

Imagine that something goes wrong, we know that this never happens but just in case. We can do a very `quick rollback` just by undoing the change in the `dstrategies-back` online service.

**Argo Rollouts** has an https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/generated/kubectl-argo-rollouts/kubectl-argo-rollouts_undo/[undo] command to do the rollback. In our opinion, we don't like this procedure because it is not aligned with GitOps. The changes that **Argo Rollouts** do does not come from git, so git is OutOfSync with what we have in Openshift.
In our case the commit that we have done not only changes the ReplicaSet but also the ConfigMap. The `undo` command only changes the ReplicaSet, so it does not work for us.

I recommend doing the changes in git. We will revert the last commit

**ArgoCD** will get the changes and apply them. **Argo Rollouts** will create a new revision with the previous version.
