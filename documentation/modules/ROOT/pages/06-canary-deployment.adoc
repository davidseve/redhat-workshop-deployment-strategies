# Canary deployment strategy
include::_attributes.adoc[]

A canary deployment is a strategy where the operator releases a new version of their application to a small percentage of the production traffic. This small percentage may test the new version and provide feedback. If the new version is working well the operator may increase the percentage, till all the traffic is using the new version. Unlike Blue/Green, canary deployments are smoother, and failures have limited impact.

## Deploy Shop Application

We are going to create the application `dstrategies`, that we will use to test canary deployment. Because we will make changes in the application's GitHub repository, we have to use the repository that you have just forked. Please edit the following yaml and set your own GitHub repository in the `reportURL`. Create a file called `application-dstrategies-canary.yaml`

## Application architecture

To achieve canary deployment with `Cloud Native` applications using **Argo Rollouts**, we have designed this architecture.

image::canary-rollout-step-0.png["Shop initial status"]

OpenShift Components - Online

- Routes and Services declared with the suffix -online
- Routes mapped only to the online services
- Services mapped to the rollout.

In Blue/Green deployment we always have an offline service to test the version that is not in production. In the case of canary deployment we do not need it because progressively we will have the new version in production. 


We can also see the rollout`s status.

We have defined an active or online service 'dstrategies-back-online'. Final user will always use 'dstrategies-back-online'. When a new version is deployed **Argo Rollouts** create a new revision (ReplicaSet). The number of replicas in the new release increases based on the information in the steps, and the number of replicas in the old release decreases by the same number. We have configured a pause duration between each step. To learn more about **Argo Rollouts**, please read [this](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/features/canary/).

This is how we have configured **Argo Rollouts** strategy for this demo, you can check it here `helm/helm-umbrella-dstrategies/chart/values/canary/values-rollouts-strategy.yaml`

Notice that in each microservice response we have added metadata information to see better the `version` of each application. This will help us to see the changes while we do the canary deployment.
We can see that the current version is `V1.0.0`:


## Dstrategies-back canary deployment

We have split a `Cloud Native` Canary deployment into three automatic step:

1. Deploy canary version for 10%
2. Scale the canary version to 50%
3. Scale the canary version to 100%

This is just an example. The key point here is that very easily we can have the canary deployment that better fits our needs. To make this demo faster we have not set a pause without duration in any step, so  **Argo Rollouts** will go throw each step automatically.

### Step 1 - Deploy the canary version for 10%
 
We will deploy a new version V2.0.0. To do it, we have to edit the file `helm/helm-umbrella-dstrategies/chart/values/canary/values-image-tag.yaml` under `dstrategies-back` set `tag` value to `v.1.1.1`

[.console-input]
[source,input,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
dstrategies-back:
   image:
     tag: V2.0.0
----

**Argo Rollouts** will automatically deploy a new dstrategies-back revision. The canary version will be 10% of the replicas. In this demo we are no using [traffic management](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/features/traffic-management/). **Argo Rollouts** makes a best-effort attempt to achieve the percentage listed in the last setWeight step between the new and old version. This means that it will create only one replica in the new revision because it is rounded up. All the requests are load balanced between the old and the new replicas.

Push the changes to start the deployment.

In the dstrategies-back URL response, you will have the new version in 25% of the requests.

New revision:


Old revision:


### Step 2 - Scale the canary version to 50%
After 30 seconds **Argo Rollouts** automatically will increase the number of replicas in the new release to 2. Instead of increasing automatically after 30 seconds, we can configure **Argo Rollouts** to wait indefinitely until that `Pause` condition is removed. But this is not part of this demo.

### Rollback

Imagine that something goes wrong, we know that this never happens but just in case. We can do a very `quick rollback` just by undoing the change.

**Argo Rollouts** has an [undo](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/generated/kubectl-argo-rollouts/kubectl-argo-rollouts_undo/) command to do the rollback. In my opinion, I don't like this procedure because it is not aligned with GitOps. The changes that **Argo Rollouts** do does not come from git, so git is OutOfSync with what we have in Openshift.
In our case the commit that we have done not only changes the ReplicaSet but also the ConfigMap. The `undo` command only changes the ReplicaSet, so it does not work for us.

I recommend doing the changes in git. We will revert the last commit
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git revert HEAD --no-edit
----

If we just revert the changes in git we will go back to the previous version. But **Argo Rollouts** will take this revert as a new release so it will do it throw the steps that we have configured. We want a `quick rollback` we don't want a step-by-step revert. To achieve the `quick rollback` we will configure **Argo Rollouts** without steps for the rollback.

Because we have our **Argo Rollouts** configuration as values in our Helm Chart, we have just to edit the values.yaml that we are using.

In the file `helm/helm-umbrella-dstrategies/chart/values/canary/values-rollouts-strategy.yaml` under `dstrategies-back` under the `steps` delete all the steps and only set one step `- setWeight: 100`

`helm/helm-umbrella-dstrategies/chart/values/canary/values-rollouts-strategy.yaml` should looks like:

[.console-input]
[source,input,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
dstrategies-back:
   rollouts:
      canary:
         steps:
            - setWeight: 100
----

Execute those commands to push the changes:

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "delete steps for rollback"
git push
----

**ArgoCD** will get the changes and apply them. **Argo Rollouts** will create a new revision with the previous version.

The rollback is done!

To get the application ready for a new release we should configure again the  **Argo Rollouts** with the steps.
