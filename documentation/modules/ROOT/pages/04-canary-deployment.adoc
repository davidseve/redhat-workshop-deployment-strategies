= Canary deployment strategy
include::_attributes.adoc[]

As mentioned before, a canary deployment is a strategy where the operator releases a new version of their application to a small percentage of the production traffic. This small percentage may test the new version and provide feedback. If the new version is working well the operator may increase the percentage, till all the traffic is using the new version.

== Generate DStrategies APP GitOps Deployment Model

First of all, it is required to review a set of objects in a our forked git repository in order to configure the deployment correctly for deploying our application following a GitOps model.

Please follow the next section to understand the required objects and configurations.

=== Review and Modify Rollout strategy

As you know so well, the Rollout object controls the application deployment. If you look closely, it is possible to find many similarities between an Argo Rollout objects and a Kubernetes Deployment. The main different btween the previous objects referenced is the rollout strategy field. 

Please edit a file named *./canary/dstrategies-back-rollout.yaml* in oder to define **<TIME>** as *30s* and understand the canary deployment strategy:

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
  strategy:
    canary:
      analysis:
        startingStep: 1
        templates:
        - templateName: dstrategies-back-analysis-template
      steps:
      - setWeight: 25
      - pause:
          duration: <TIME>
      - setWeight: 50
      - pause:
          duration: <TIME>
----

=== Modify Analysis Template 

Please edit a file named *./canary/dstrategies-back-analysis-template.yaml* in oder to add the required **<USERNAME>** that helps to reference the user namespace in the healthcheck url.

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
  metrics:
    - name: dstrategies-back-webmetric
      provider:
        web:
          jsonPath: '{$.status}'
          url: >-
            http://dstrategies-back-online.<USERNAME>-canary.svc.cluster.local:8080/q/health/ready
      successCondition: result == 'UP'
----

NOTE: For more information about AnalysisTemplate, please visit the following https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/features/bluegreen/[link].

=== Modify back service URL

Finally, it is required to create a **Deployment** object in order to deploy the frontend application. This application helps us to test the canary rollout strategy from a web interface and see backend information.

In order to allow communication between the frontend and the backend, it is required to edit the file named *./canary/dstrategies-frontend-deployment.yaml* in oder to add the required **<USERNAME>** and **<OCP_APPS_DOMAIN>**.

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
        env:  
          - name: REACT_APP_BACK
            value: http://dstrategies-back-online-<USERNAME>-canary.<OCP_APPS_DOMAIN>/dstrategies-back
          - name: REACT_APP_CATEGORY
            value: CANARY
----

=== Commit and Push the Changes

Once all the files are configured correctly, it is time to commit and push all changes to the repository that you have just forked.

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Configured DStrategies App deployment files for canary strategy"
git push
----

== Deploy Dstrategies Application

We are going to create the application *dstrategies*, that we will use to test canary deployment. Because we will make changes in the application's GitHub repository, we have to use the repository that you have just forked. Please edit the following yaml and set your own GitHub repository in the *reportURL*. Create a file called *application-dstrategies-canary.yaml*

[.console-input]
[source,input,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----

Looking at the Argo CD dashboard, you would notice that we have a new *dstrategies* application.

image::argocd_dstrategies-canary.png["ArgoCD Dstrategies"]

== Application architecture

To achieve canary deployment with *Cloud Native* applications using **Argo Rollouts**, we have designed this architecture.

image::canary-rollout-step-0.png["Dstrategies initial status"]

OpenShift Components - Online

- Routes and Services declared with the suffix -online
- Routes mapped only to the online services
- Services mapped to the rollout.

In Blue/Green deployment we always have an offline service to test the version that is not in production. In the case of canary deployment we do not need it because progressively we will have the new version in production. 

We can also see the rollout*s status.

We have defined an active or online service 'dstrategies-back-online'. Final user will always use 'dstrategies-back-online'. When a new version is deployed **Argo Rollouts** create a new revision (ReplicaSet). The number of replicas in the new release increases based on the information in the steps, and the number of replicas in the old release decreases by the same number. We have configured a pause duration between each step. To learn more about **Argo Rollouts**, please read [this](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/features/canary/).

This is how we have configured **Argo Rollouts** strategy for this demo, you can check it here *helm/helm-umbrella-dstrategies/chart/values/canary/values-rollouts-strategy.yaml*

== Test Dstrategies application
 
We have deployed the *dstrategies* with ArgoCD. We can test that it is up and running.
 
In order to test the online service, it is required to extract the frontend url:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get route dstrategies-frontend -n {user}-canary -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'
----

Visit the frontend route via your web browser, push - JUMP- button and ensure the following message is displaying in your screen:

.Frontend Interface
image::frontend-canary.png["Frontend Interface"]

Notice that in each microservice response we have added metadata information to see better the *version* of each application. This will help us to see the changes while we do the canary deployment.  We can see that the current version is *V1.0.0*.

== Dstrategies-back canary deployment

We have split a *Cloud Native* Canary deployment into three automatic step:

1. Deploy canary version for 25%
2. Scale the canary version to 50%
3. Scale the canary version to 100%

This is just an example. The key point here is that very easily we can have the canary deployment that better fits our needs. To make this demo faster we have not set a pause without duration in any step, so  **Argo Rollouts** will go throw each step automatically.

To test canary deployment we are going to do changes in the backend application dstrategies-back.

### Step 1 - Deploy the canary version for 10%
 
We will deploy a new version *V2.0.0*. To do it, we have to edit the files *./canary/dstrategies-back-rollout.yaml* and *./canary/dstrategies-back-configmap.yaml* in order to modify the value *v1.0.0* to *V2.0.0*:

[.console-input]
[source,input,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
          image: 'quay.io/dseveria/dstrategies-back:V1.0.0' <---
----
[.console-input]

[source,input,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
  application.version: V1.0.0 <---
----

Before appliying these changes, it is important to monitor the current version via the frontend. In order to track all canary process, it is required to prepare the frontend to generate multiples requests.

Extract the frontend url:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get route dstrategies-frontend -n {user}-canary -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'
----

Visit the frontend route via your web browser, edit the number of *Calls Retries* to 10000 and push - JUMP- button and ensure the following message is displaying in your screen:

.Frontend Interface
image::frontend-canary-v1.png["Frontend Interface"]

**Argo Rollouts** will automatically deploy a new dstrategies-back revision. The canary version will be 25% of the replicas. In this demo we are not using [traffic management](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/features/traffic-management/). **Argo Rollouts** makes a best-effort attempt to achieve the percentage listed in the last setWeight step between the new and old version. This means that it will create only one replica in the new revision because it is rounded up. All the requests are load balanced between the old and the new replicas.

Push the changes to start the deployment.
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Change dstrategies-back version to V2.0.0"
git push
----

ArgoCD will refresh the status after some minutes. If you don't want to wait you can refresh it manually from ArgoCD UI.

In the dstrategies-back URL response, you will have the new version in 25% of the requests.

New revision:

.Frontend Interface
image::frontend-canary-v2.png["Frontend Interface"]

Old revision:

.Frontend Interface
image::frontend-canary-v1.png["Frontend Interface"]

### Step 2 - Scale the canary version to 50%

After 60 seconds **Argo Rollouts** automatically will increase the number of replicas in the new release to 2. Instead of increasing automatically after 60 seconds, we can configure **Argo Rollouts** to wait indefinitely until that *Pause* condition is removed. But this is not part of this demo.

### Rollback

Imagine that something goes wrong, we know that this never happens but just in case. We can do a very *quick rollback* just by undoing the change.

**Argo Rollouts** has an https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/generated/kubectl-argo-rollouts/kubectl-argo-rollouts_undo/[undo] command to do the rollback. In our opinion, we don't like this procedure because it is not aligned with GitOps. The changes that **Argo Rollouts** do does not come from git, so git is OutOfSync with what we have in Openshift.
In our case the commit that we have done not only changes the ReplicaSet but also the ConfigMap. The *undo* command only changes the ReplicaSet, so it does not work for us.

I recommend doing the changes in git. We will revert the last commit
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git revert HEAD --no-edit
----

If we just revert the changes in git we will go back to the previous version. But **Argo Rollouts** will take this revert as a new release so it will do it throw the steps that we have configured. We want a *quick rollback* we don't want a step-by-step revert. To achieve the *quick rollback* we will configure **Argo Rollouts** without steps for the rollback.

Because we have our **Argo Rollouts** configuration as values in our Helm Chart, we have just to edit the values.yaml that we are using.

In the file *./canary/dstrategies-back-rollout.yaml*  under *dstrategies-back* under the *steps* delete all the steps and only set one step *- setWeight: 100*:

[.console-input]
[source,input,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
dstrategies-back:
   rollouts:
      canary:
         steps:
            - setWeight: 100
----

Execute those commands to push the changes:

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "delete steps for rollback"
git push
----

**ArgoCD** will get the changes and apply them. **Argo Rollouts** will create a new revision with the previous version.

The rollback is done!

image::canary-rollout-step-Rollback.png["Dstrategies Step Rollback"]

In order to test the online service, it is required to extract the frontend url:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get route dstrategies-frontend -n {user}-canary -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'
----

Visit the frontend route via your web browser, push - JUMP- button and ensure the following message is displaying in your screen:

.Frontend Interface
image::frontend-canary.png["Frontend Interface"]


To get the application ready for a new release we should configure again the  **Argo Rollouts** with the steps.
