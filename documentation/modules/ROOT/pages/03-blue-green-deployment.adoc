= Blue/Green deployment strategy
include::_attributes.adoc[]

== Application architecture

As mentioned before, we have a very simple application with two services. One frontal React app called *dstrategies-front* and one backend Quarkus app called *dstrategies-back*. We will use the front app to call several times the back app and see how the back version change during the deployment.

To achieve Blue/Green deployment with *Cloud Native* applications using **Argo Rollouts**, we have designed this architecture.

This is the initial situation after deploying the application:

image::rollout-blue-green-step-0.png["DStrategies initial status"]

OpenShift Components - Online

- Routes and Services declared with the suffix -online
- Routes mapped only to the online services
- Services mapped to the rollout.
 
OpenShift Components - Offline

- Routes and Services declared with the suffix -offline
- Routes mapped only to the offline services
- Services mapped to the rollout

We will define an active or online service 'dstrategies-back-online' and a preview or offline service 'dstrategies-back-offline'. The idea is that the frontend will always use 'dstrategies-back-online' and 'dstrategies-back-offline' will only be used to test our service before triggering the rollout.

== Generate DStrategies APP GitOps Deployment Model

First of all, it is required to review a set of objects in our forked git repository to configure the deployment correctly for deploying our application following a GitOps model.

Please follow the next section to understand the required objects and configurations.

=== Review Services

As the previous picture shows, it is required to generate a couple of services that will be used to redirect the traffic to the correct DStrategies App version. 

Please take a look at the files *./blue-green/dstrategies-back-service-online.yaml* and *./blue-green/dstrategies-back-service-offline.yaml* to understand the objects and get the names of these elements.

=== Modify Rollout strategy

The Rollout object controls the application deployment. If you look closely, it is possible to find many similarities between an Argo Rollout object and a Kubernetes Deployment. The main difference between the previous objects referenced is the rollout strategy field. 

Please edit a file named *./blue-green/dstrategies-back-rollout.yaml* in oder to add the required **<SERVICE_OFFLINE>** and **<SERVICE_ONLINE>** service names:

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
  strategy:
    blueGreen:
      activeService: <SERVICE_ONLINE>
      autoPromotionEnabled: false
      prePromotionAnalysis:
        templates:
          - templateName: dstrategies-back-analysis-template
      previewService: <SERVICE_OFFLINE>
----

=== Modify Analysis Template 

We have created an AnalysisTemplate 'dstrategies-back-analysis-template' that just validates the health of the application, for production environments a better analysis should be done. **Argo Rollouts** use this AnalysisTemplate to validate a new version and set whether it is ready to be promoted or not.

Please edit the file named *./blue-green/dstrategies-back-analysis-template.yaml* to add the required **<USERNAME>** that helps to reference the user namespace in the healthcheck URL.

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
  metrics:
    - name: dstrategies-back-webmetric
      provider:
        web:
          jsonPath: '{$.status}'
          url: >-
            http://dstrategies-back-offline.<USERNAME>-blue-green.svc.cluster.local:8080/q/health/ready
      successCondition: result == 'UP'
----

NOTE: For more information about AnalysisTemplate, please visit the following https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/features/bluegreen/[link].

=== Modify back service URL

Finally, it is required to create a **Deployment** object to deploy the frontend application. This application helps us to test the blue-green rollout strategy from a web interface and see backend information.

To allow communication between the frontend and the backend, it is required to edit the file named *./blue-green/dstrategies-frontend-deployment.yaml* to add the required **<USERNAME>** and **<OCP_APPS_DOMAIN>**.

[source,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
        env:  
          - name: REACT_APP_BACK
            value: http://dstrategies-back-online-<USERNAME>-blue-green.<OCP_APPS_DOMAIN>/dstrategies-back
          - name: REACT_APP_CATEGORY
            value: BLUE-GREEN
----

=== Commit and Push the Changes

Once all the files are configured correctly, it is time to commit and push all changes to the repository that you have just forked.

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Configured DStrategies App deployment files"
git push
----

== Argo CD Application

We are going to create the application *DStrategies* to apply the files modified previously to test Blue/Green deployment. Please edit the following yaml and set your own GitHub repository in the *reportURL*. Create a file called *application-dstrategies-blue-green.yaml*

[.console-input]
[source,input,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: dstrategies-blue-green
  namespace: {user}-gitops-argocd

    namespace: {user}-blue-green
    server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
  source:
    path: blue-green
    repoURL: https://github.com/change_me/dstrategies-app-deployment
    targetRevision: HEAD
  project: default
  syncPolicy:

      prune: false
      selfHeal: true
----

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -f application-dstrategies-blue-green.yaml
----

Looking at the Argo CD dashboard, you would notice that we have a new *DStrategies* application.

image::argocd_dstrategies-blue-green.png["ArgoCD DStrategies"]

NOTE: It is important to wait for *Healthy* and *Synced* status in the Argo CD Application

== Test Dstrategies application
 
We have deployed the *DStrategies* with ArgoCD. We can test the online and offline services to ensure that they are up and running.

To test the online service, it is required to extract the frontend URL:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get route dstrategies-frontend -n {user}-blue-green -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}'
----

Or you can use this http://dstrategies-frontend-{user}-blue-green.apps.%CLUSTER%/[URL]

Visit the frontend via your web browser, push - JUMP - button and ensure the following message is displaying on your screen:

.Frontend Interface
image::frontend-blue-green.png["Frontend Interface"]

In addition, regarding testing the offline service, it is required to get the Offline route:

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl "$(oc get routes dstrategies-back-offline -n {user}-blue-green --template='http://{{.spec.host}}')/dstrategies-back"
----

[.console-output]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
{"metadata":{"version":"V1.0.0","colour":"Green"}}
----

Notice that in each microservice response we have added metadata information to see better the *version* of each application. This will help us to see the changes while we do the Blue/Green deployment.
Because right now we have both routers against the same rollout revision we will have the same response with version *V1.0.0*:

We can also see the rollout's status.

TIP: Argo Rollouts offers a Kubectl plugin to enrich the experience with Rollouts https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/installation/#kubectl-plugin-installation 

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----

== DStrategies-back Blue/Green deployment

We have split a *Cloud Native* Blue/Green deployment into two steps:

1. Deploy a new version.
2. Promote a new version
 
To test Blue/Green deployment we are going to do changes in the backend application *dstrategies-back*.
 
We have already deployed the *dstrategies-back* version V1.0.0, and we have a new dstrategies-back version V2.0.0 ready to be deployed. 

=== Step 1 - Deploy a new version
 
We will deploy a new version *V2.0.0*. To do it, we have to edit the files *./blue-green/dstrategies-back-rollout.yaml* and *./blue-green/dstrategies-back-configmap.yaml* to modify the value *v1.0.0* to *V2.0.0*:

[.console-input]
[source,input,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
          image: 'quay.io/dseveria/dstrategies-back:V2.0.0' <---
----

[.console-input]
[source,input,yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
  application.version: V2.0.0 <---
----

And push the changes

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git add .
git commit -m "Change dstrategies-back version to V2.0.0"
git push
----

ArgoCD will refresh the status after some minutes. If you don't want to wait you can refresh it manually from ArgoCD UI.

image::argocd-Dstrategies-blue-green-Refresh.png["Refresh DStrategies"]
 
**Argo Rollouts** will automatically deploy the new dstrategies-back version and execute the *prePromotionAnalysis*. 

[.console-output]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc argo rollouts get rollout dstrategies-back --watch -n {user}-blue-green
NAME                                  KIND         STATUS        AGE  INFO

----
  
If the *prePromotionAnalysis* goes well, we can see that offline applications have version V2.0.0 and the new attribute description, but the online version has not changed.

This is our current status:

image::rollout-blue-green-step-1.png["Dstrategies Step 1]

To test the online service, you can use the frontend http://dstrategies-frontend-{user}-blue-green.apps.%CLUSTER%/[URL]

Visit the frontend route via your web browser, push - JUMP- button and ensure the following message is displaying on your screen:

.Frontend Interface
image::frontend-blue-green.png["Frontend Interface"]

We can see that nothing has changed for the users.

In addition, regarding testing the offline service, it is required to get the Offline route and check the version is **V2.0.0** and the colour is *Blue*:

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl "$(oc get routes dstrategies-back-offline -n {user}-blue-green --template='http://{{.spec.host}}')/dstrategies-back"
----

[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
{"metadata":{"version":"V2.0.0","colour":"Blue"}}
----

Functional testing users can execute *Smoke tests* to validate this new V2.0.0 version.

We have to be careful with those tests in a production environment because the product microservice will call the online dependencies.
If this dependency is for example a production DB we will create the things.
 
=== Step 2 - Promote a new version
 
We are going to open the new version to final users.

Argo Rollouts provide this command to promote dstrategies-back:
[.console-input]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc argo rollouts promote dstrategies-back -n {user}-blue-green
----

First **Argo Rollouts** will just change the service to use the new release (ReplicaSet). We *minimize downtime* because it just changes the service label. 

[.console-output]
[source,input,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc argo rollouts get rollout dstrategies-back --watch -n {user}-blue-green
NAME                                  KIND         STATUS        AGE  INFO

      └──□ dstrategies-back-67fc9fb79b-p7jk9  Pod          ✔ Running     88m  ready:1/1
----
This is our current status:

image::rollout-blue-green-step-2-initial.png["Dstrategies Step 2 initial"]

And after *scaleDownDelaySeconds* **Argo Rollouts** will scale down the first replicaSet (V1.0.0).

----

This is our final status:

image::rollout-blue-green-step-2.png["Dstrategies Step 2"]

To test the new online service, you can use the frontend http://dstrategies-frontend-{user}-blue-green.apps.%CLUSTER%/[URL]

Visit the frontend route via your web browser, push - JUMP- button and ensure the following message is displaying on your screen:

.Frontend Interface
image::frontend-blue-green-v2.png["Frontend Interface V2.0.0"]

**We have in the online environment the new version V2.0.0!!!**

=== Rollback

Imagine that something goes wrong, we know that this never happens but just in case. We can do a very *quick rollback* just by undoing the change in the *dstrategies-back* online service.

**Argo Rollouts** has an https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/generated/kubectl-argo-rollouts/kubectl-argo-rollouts_undo/[undo] command to do the rollback. In our opinion, we don't like this procedure because it is not aligned with GitOps. The changes that **Argo Rollouts** do does not come from git, so git is OutOfSync with what we have in Openshift.
In our case the commit that we have done not only changes the ReplicaSet but also the ConfigMap. The *undo* command only changes the ReplicaSet, so it does not work for us.

I recommend doing the changes in git. We will revert the last commit
[.console-input]

**ArgoCD** will get the changes and apply them. **Argo Rollouts** will create a new revision with the previous version.
